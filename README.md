# Todo Application with C4 Model Documentation

This repository contains a simple Todo application built with Next.js. The primary purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how to document a software system using the C4 model for visualizing software architecture.

The `todo-app` directory contains the application itself, and its `README.md` file contains the detailed documentation and diagrams.
